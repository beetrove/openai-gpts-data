### ETL Stages

ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) is a process used to gather and prepare data for analysis.

- **Stage 1**: Extracted raw nested JSON data by crawling GPT pages.
- **Stage 2**: Transformed nested JSON data into flat CSV files.
- **Stage 3**: Normalized data by processing the full history to compile simpler tables that contain the latest details and a timeline of performance metrics (Conversations, Stars, Reviews).

#### Download Large Files from Google Drive

The files for ETL stages 1 and 2 are too large to be hosted on GitHub. To access the complete raw data, download the files from the following Google Drive link:
